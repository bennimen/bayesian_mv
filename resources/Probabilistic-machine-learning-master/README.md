# Uncertainty and Data Science
This practice aims to data analysis and machine learning algorithms. Uncertainty quantification will be done mainly through Bayesian approach and will rely on computational statistics (Monte Carlo). Uncertainty means: getting systems to estimate how much they do not know.
The practice will be focused more on practical aspects of uncertainty quantification, so that a new probabilistic programming methods (PyMC3) for modelling uncertainties are used. 
Topics that will be covered are related to:

Key words: Bayesian analysis, Uncertainty quantification, Probabilistic programming, Data analysis, Modeling, Monte Carlo analysis, Bayesian machine learning, Measurement, Errors...
